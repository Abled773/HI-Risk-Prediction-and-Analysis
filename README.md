Project plan:
Have you ever been curious as to what is considered in determining a policyholder's risk? That
is what we intend to look into the Medical Insurance Cost Prediction Analysis. This Database’s
size is 100,000 rows and 54 columns, and we aim to determine which columns hold the most
weight in the risk score. Some examples of the data columns are: number of claims, bmi,
smoking history, and blood pressure.
In this analysis we plan to:
● Investigate trends and correlation in the data
● Visualize correlation to support findings
● Determine the most influential risk factors that contribute to risk scores
● Demonstrate and prove risk factor influence using data visualization
● Look into any interesting insights that may arise during analysis
● Create a classification model to determine high or low risk
○ Potentially create a regressive model to provide a risk score
